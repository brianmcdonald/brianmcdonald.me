Summary: This page is an in-progress list of books that I've read or am currently reading. 

I recently stumbled across [OpenLibrary.org][OpenLibrary.org], a site who's vision is to:

> make all the published works of humankind available to everyone in the world. __-Open Library__ 

The sites software and data (over 20 million records) are open source. The late [Aaron Swartz][Aaron Swartz] was involved in its creation. In support of this _public good_ ethos I decided to donate a small amount to them and suggest improvemnets on the sites Github repository. 

Partially inspired by my girlfriend's log of books she has read (I think she has read over 60 books so far in 2020). I decided to begin the task of loggin books I have read, am reading now or am planning to read, and to use their [API][API] to show them on this page. It's still a work in progress, so only a few books appear for now. In the future I'll add short reviews for books that really grab my interest.
