Summary: This page is an in-progress list of books that I've read or am currently reading. 

Sometime in mid-2021 I stumbled across [OpenLibrary.org][OpenLibrary.org], a site with a vision to:

> make all the published works of humankind available to everyone in the world. __-Open Library__ 

The sites software and data (over 20 million records) are open source. The late [Aaron Swartz][Aaron Swartz] was involved in its creation. As the world's information and means of online communication move slowly under the control of large companies whose primary purpose is to sell advertising and to vaccum up our personal information. The _public good_ ethos of this site stand out at something to both value and to support. I encourage you to check it out and if you find it useful, to support the project either through donations or by helping them improve the platform.

I've started to log the books I've recently read in Open Library and will include below those I feel worth recommending.
