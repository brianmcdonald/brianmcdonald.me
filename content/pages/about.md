Summary: Brian Mc Donald is a humanitarian information management specialist based in Geneva

Hi! My name is Brian Mc Donald. I'm from Ireland, currently living on the outskirts of Geneva. For the past 9 years I've worked in the Humanitarian Response field, primarily on Information Management. My work focuses mainly on data collection, analysis (including geospatial) and data visualization/storytelling. I have a deep interest in how people engage with data and the systems which influence its creation and use. My concerns include the expanding asymmetries of power of our digital age.

I'm an experienced whitewater kayaker, having paddled in Chile, Peru, Uganda, South Sudan, Georgia, northern India, Nepal, Norway and across Europe. I still try to go kayaking in the alps on the occasional weekend, so kayaking partners are always welcome.

## About this website

I started this website as a way to improve my writing skills and to work on synthesizing some of what I've been learning into articulate thoughts that can be of help to future me or others.
I lament the loss of much of the independent expression of content on the internet these days, with our communications and expressions mediated by the platforms of multi-billion dollar companies and incentives driven by advertising and increased consumption. This blog is a chance for me to craft something that is both independent from these "mediators" and specific to my needs and specifications. 

**Why does this website website load fast and doesn't have those annoying cookie popups?**
  
As per the [GDPR][GDPR], those cookie consent boxes are only required if a website tracks your sessions. Nothing on this site tracks its users, allowing the site to focus on being a fast and somewhat less user hostile experience.

The technical details of this site - it's built using [Python][Python] and the static site generator [Pelican][Pelican]. It is hosted on [Github][Github]
