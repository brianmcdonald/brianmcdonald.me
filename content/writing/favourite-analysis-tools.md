Summary: A collection of some of my favourite analysis tools and why I find them so useful.

I hope to update this collection over time. 

### Bread and butter humanitarian IM tools ###
**Excel:** While I believed Excel is overused and misused in our field. It remains the main format of information sharing and tool for analysis in responses.  
__QGIS:__ A jewel in the crown of FOSS.  
**Inkscape:** This FOSS vector editor work on windows and mac and is a very capable replacement for Adobe Illustrator. It can import pdf files and is a great tool for putting finishing touches to maps.  
**Power Point:**

### Tools I want to explore more
**Datasette**
This superb tool takes any SQLlite database and turns it into a web API.  
**Visidata**
A command line tool for working with tabular data.
