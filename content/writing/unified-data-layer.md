## Common Operating Datasets
The work done on Common Operating Datasets (CODs) has been one of the most important advances in information management in humanitarian response in the past 20 years.

Common Operating Datasets are typically country level administrative and population figures....
They are the basic building blocks of a response. They are a great example of coordination of information management, with all agencies and NGOs using them.

but ...

But the purpose of this post is not just to praise the CODs, it's to discuss alternatives that overcomes many of the their shortcomings and could supplant their place as the building blocks of humanitarian response.

## Unified data layer
- use when dealing with larger data.

- example use in Pakistan - climate indicators, distributions, camps, old boundaries

- limitations - cells may not have desired homogeneity that other area classifications have and may not align with administrative structures or topography. 

- conclusion

- footnote explaining that the claims of the demise of CODs are premature, but they will likely live alongside each other.
